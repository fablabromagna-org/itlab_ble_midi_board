 * ITLab BLE MIDI Board Client
 * Copyright (C) 2021 Ivan Tarozzi (itarozzi@gmail.com) 
 * 
 * [https://github.com/itarozzi/itlab_ble_midi_board]
 * 
 *
 * A BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) MIDI implementation based on ESP32
 * 
 * This source is part of a project to build a BLE MIDI Pedal Board
 * I created this project to control music and guitar applications,
 * but you can use it for any BLE MIDI compatible application ;)
 * 
 * You can find the full project documentation on github page.
 * 
 * 
 * Description:
 * ------------
 * This is the first attempt to control my NUX MIGHTY PLUG.
 * It connects to the first MIDI BLE device found, and send 
 * MIDI CC 49 every 5 seconds, changing NUX preset channel
